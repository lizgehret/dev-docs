Semantic Validation
===================

   :local:

One of the key features of QIIME 2 is the enforcement of appropriate data storage and utilization, based
 on the type of data (also referred to as the semantic type). One of the tools used to implement this is
 validation. There are currently two validation methods available for for use within the QIIME 2
 Framework: Format Validation and Semantic Validation.

Format Validation
-----------------
Why do this????? To enforce a schema on the data.

Where do we define a format?

How is it implemented?

Semantic Validation
-------------------
Why do this?????
In an attempt to decouple formats and semantic types within the QIIME 2 Ecosystem, validation has been
 implemented on semantic types, as well as formats.

Where do we define a semantic type?
Can link off to semantic and primitive types here.
